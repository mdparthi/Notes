===========================================

If i tell you some company to Not go with them will lower your risk. At present i can not tell the best dropshipping company in india because i am still searching, but i can tell you Not to go with some company, i have some bad experience :

1.Snazzyway and 2. Seasonsway both are same owner company

There are many reasons to Not to choose Snazzyway i am struggling with below mention issues which does’t match with the information you are providing :

1.Total Number of product provided only 4000 only instead of 15000 committed on website .

2. No support for How to list on any website(ebay, Amazon, not on a single one)

3. No reply of your mail after payment for drop shipping plan.Before payment they will reply for every mail.

4. Most of the product does’t have any Brand Name.

5. No inventory update, they will simply provide excel sheet only ones

6. They will not provide the demanding product (all the product which i got in out of stock mail i didn’t get single product in my list )

7.Image quality of product is not good

8.They will Stop replying your phone call.

9. No refund policy

these all issues are personally experienced issues ﻿

One most important thing i want to tell all new comers who want to start dropshipping is :

1.collect as many as information like facilities and support provided by company in written form(before payment)

2. Refund Policy

3. Compare price of product with other sellers on ebay and Amazon

4. Before purchasing dropshipping plan try to first register yourself as a seller on different market place like ebay, amazon, paytm, flipkart, shopclues etc

On registering you will know the exact document requirements to become a seller

5. Ask dropshipping company as they will provide all the product they are showing on their website ( snazzyway is not doing that)

I also request all readers to share there real experiences (only )
